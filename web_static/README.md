`AirBnb_Clone` project from Holberton School, it's a project to implement a clone of the AirBnB page. this folder contains the html and css structure for the web.

## Description

Will do the next task, just as it is propused: Create simple HTML static pages, Style guide, Fake contents, No Javascript, No data loaded from anything

During this project, you will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. I really encourage you to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you canâ€™t apply any design.
