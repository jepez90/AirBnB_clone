                            <p>I was super impressed with the thoughtful touches - having the Disney plus signed in on the TV with an "Airbnb guest" account available, nice, full bottles of products in the shower and an array of teas and snacks available. This place was a 5 minute drive from my sister's house and a perfect place for me and my kitty to stay. The space is quaint, comfy and a great value for the area.</p>

                            <p>JaLane is a very accommodating and friendly host. We really appreciated that she worked through the minute details of our stay with us to make sure we were comfortable. We traveled with a small pup. JaLane gave clear and understandable house rules for dogs while also giving our pup lots of love and space to run around outside. </p>

                            <p>A fantastic place to stay if you're looking for a little open natural space vs the community style complexes of Fraser in Winter Park. With a just short drive to Winter Park, that is more than worth the trade off for the beautiful backdoor view</p>
